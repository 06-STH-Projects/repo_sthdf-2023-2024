* The project centers around the creation of a specialized 3D-printed drumstick holder designed to enhance the accessibility and organization of drumsticks for drummers during performances and practice sessions.
* This holder is engineered to securely store drumsticks in an upright position, enabling musicians to swiftly grab or replace their sticks with minimal effort and interruption to their play.
