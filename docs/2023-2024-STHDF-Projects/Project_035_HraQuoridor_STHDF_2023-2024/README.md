# Portable Board Game - Quoridor

## Authors - Leonard Puškáč, Ema Richnáková

This project involves the redesign of a relatively popular board game called Quoridor. The game itself is about finding the shortest path to the other end of the board, while making the path of the opponent longer.

The original rendition of the game has a classic board game format - a board with some game pieces - all in a cardboard box.

## The aim of our project is to:
1. Redesign the form of the game such that it is more portable
2. Learn to use a resin based 3D print
