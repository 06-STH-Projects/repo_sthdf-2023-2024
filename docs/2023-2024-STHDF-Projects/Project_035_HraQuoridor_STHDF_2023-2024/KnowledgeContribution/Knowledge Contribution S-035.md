# 02. KNOWLEDGE CONTRIBUTION (S035)

## Author info
 My name is Leonard Puškáč, and I... contribute... knowledge... to this project... naturally. I come from the bustling metropolis of Malacky. I'm a "software developer" / a "programmer".

 ## The knowledge (being contributed)

 I the main thing I think that I bring to the team is my creativity. That is, both in terms of the creative process required to produce a final product, and in terms of how to effectively do the least amount of work possible. 

 The reason for my incredible contributory abilities is probably my personality (a natural phelgmatic) and my background. As was very briefly stated in my "ABOUT ME" document, I come from a hobby-diverse background (art, sports, games...) and a background that supported a wide variety of interests - both my famlity and my high school. This allows me to be interested in something just enough to have a vision and be excited for what I want to achieve, and also not be that interesed to be perfectionist. I am a great campaigner when it comes to new exciting ideas and inspiring people to take an interest in them as well. Although, I am not so great at finishing projects and taking them to the final phases.

The other important part of my "knowledge pool" that I can pour into this project is my artistic side. I have always liked both visual and functional design. And I think that I can contribute greatly when it comes to the initial idea brainstorming, and the initial phases of the design procedure. On top of that, I also think that I have an eye for imperfections (at least the major ones) that make a product be less effective or desirable - therefore, I can conribute in the fine-tuning of the product.
