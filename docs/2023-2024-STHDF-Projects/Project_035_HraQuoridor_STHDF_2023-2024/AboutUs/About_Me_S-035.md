# 01. ABOUT ME (S035)

## 1. Education

My current studies are focused on the masters/engineering degree at FIIT STU Bratislava. My masters thesis is based on protecting neural networks against side-channel attacks. As for my previous studies, I was a part of the bilingual program at Gymnázium Jura Hronca.

## 2. Expectations and motivation for STHDF

I elected to undergo this course because of a few reasons. Firstly, the course seems like more of a hands-on type of course, which is kind of rare in my field of studies. So I wanted to give a try to something different and break the routine of only doing exact science and software-oriented projects. Secondly, I am inspired by creating things from scratch and this seems just like the course that can provide me with that type of creative outlet. 

So in terms of what I expect - I expect that I will have free reign to make something of my own while collaborating on it with my colleagues. 

## 3. My Vision and Mission

My mission, in a broader sense, is to experiment, discover, and master various avenues of being productive and creative. Whether it is through software development, art, practical creativeness (such as this course) or anything else. In the ideal world, I see myself mastering whatever creative venue I decide to go down, at least to the point that my own personal creative drive is satisfied.

## 4. Hobbies

I enjoy doing many things in my free time, namely doing sports to take my mind off things, such as running or swimming, creating art - mainly painting, drawing, and playing the guitar; but also playing video games, and watching good movies - I would say that I am, rather than not, a big movie nerd. Other than that I do enjoy reading books. Books are an outlet that lets me let my imagination run wild - I therefore like books that are written in a picturesque way. That is to say, I much prefer the feeling and atmosphere of a book (or a movie for that matter) over the story itself. The atmosphere is paramount.

## 5. Target Grade

In the ideal world, I would be satisfied with a grade of B. Mainly because I do not really value the grade itself as much as I value what I learn.

## 6. My Story

I come from a western Slovakian town called Malacky. I've attended a sports-oriented elementary school which I love to refer to with irony (as I'm not much of a sports guy, but I do indulge these days). I represented the school in a sport tho - chess - which I guess tells you something about me. 

I then went on to expand my horizons in an incredible high school - Gymnasium Jura Hronca, where creativity and open-mindedness are very much fostered. That school (the great pedagogical collective and my classmates) gave me a lot - they made me realize that there are people who are both carefree, fun to be around (yes I am talking about vices of the hedonistic kind), and yet smart and responsible. On top of that, the school supports its students not only in their studies and interests to a high degree but also on a personal level. 

Then I went on to study at FIIT Bratislava... Maybe retrospectively, I should have traveled abroad to become a little bit more self-sufficient, and again… expand my horizons. But, I guess it is good enough here (... maybe). Finishing my studies right now, I am looking forward to trying professional life, and new things.
