### Game rules

#### Objective:

The goal of Quoridor is to be the first player to reach the opposite side of the game board.

#### Setup:
The game board is set up as a 9x9 grid, and each player starts with a pawn.

Players decide who goes first.

#### Player Turns:
Player have two options:

1. Pawn Movement: The pawn can move to an adjacent square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

2. Wall Placement: Players can place a wall on the board to impede their opponent's progress. Walls are two squares long and can be placed vertically or horizontally. However, they cannot completely block a player's path, leaving at least one open route to the other side.

#### Rules for Wall Placement:
1. Walls cannot overlap or intersect with other walls.

2. Walls cannot be placed in such a way that they completely enclose any player, trapping them in a section of the board.

3. Each player has a limited number of walls (usually 10 walls in total), so they must use them strategically.

#### Winning: 

The game ends when one player successfully moves their pawn to the opposite side of the board. That player is declared the winner.
