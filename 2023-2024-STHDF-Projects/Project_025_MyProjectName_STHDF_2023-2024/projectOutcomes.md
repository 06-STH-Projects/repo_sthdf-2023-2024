# Dog-Fit
## Description
In today's rapidly evolving digital world, the health of our furry companions is becoming an increasingly important aspect of their care. With this goal in mind, we have decided to create a revolutionary product that combines the latest technologies with love for our four-legged friends. Our project is Dog-Fit, an innovative device created using digital fabrication, 3D printing, and Arduino technology, focused on monitoring the heart activity of dogs.

## Motivation
Heart activity is a critical indicator of the overall health of a dog, and that's why we decided to create a device that offers precise measurements and compatibility with everyday life.

With Dog-Fit, owners can monitor their dogs' heart rate and gain valuable insights into their level of activity, health, and overall well-being. This device is designed with the safety and comfort of dogs in mind.

Our goal is to provide owners with a reliable and modern tool for monitoring the health of their dogs, allowing them to build an even stronger and healthier bond with their loyal companions.

Dog-Fit - because the health of the dog is our priority.

## Use Cases
### Monitoring physical activity:
- Dog owners can monitor their dogs' level of physical activity using Dog-Fit, allowing them to better plan daily walks and exercise.

### Early detection of heart problems:
- Dog-Fit provides owners with the ability to monitor their dogs' heart rate in real-time, enabling early detection of potential heart issues and prompt response to veterinary care.

### Optimization of diet and exercise:
- Based on heart activity data, owners can adjust their dogs' diet and exercise regimen to support their overall health and fitness.

### Training and behavior improvement:
- Dog-Fit can be used in dog training and behavior improvement. Owners can track how heart activity changes in response to different stimuli, allowing for more effective training.

### Sleep monitoring:
- Dog-Fit can also monitor dogs' sleep patterns, giving owners a better insight into the quality of their pets' nighttime rest.

### Sharing data with a veterinarian:
- Data from Dog-Fit can be shared with a veterinarian, enabling better diagnosis and care for dogs' health during veterinary visits.

### Community interaction:
- The Dog-Fit app may offer social features such as creating dog profiles, participating in challenges and competitions with other dog owners, adding a social integration element and promoting responsible ownership.

### Alerts for irregularities:
- Dog-Fit can send owners alerts in case of irregularities in heart activity, allowing for a quick response to potential health issues.

## Conclusion - Lessons Learned
Our journey in creating the Dog-Fit project has been enlightening and has provided us with a wealth of valuable experiences. This study gave us the opportunity to delve into the processes of digital fabrication, 3D printing, and the development of devices focused on monitoring the health of our furry companions.

Throughout the hardware integration, we refined our initial design, shortened cables, adjusted dimensions, and minimized the space required for the device. This allowed us to optimize the performance and appearance of our product.

The Dog-Fit project enabled us to explore the benefits of integrating various technologies, including digital fabrication, 3D printing, and Arduino technology. We discovered that these technologies can be seamlessly combined to create innovative and functional devices.
