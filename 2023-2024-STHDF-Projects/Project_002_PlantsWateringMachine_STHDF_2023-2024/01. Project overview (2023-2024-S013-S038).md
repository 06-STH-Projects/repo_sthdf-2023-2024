| **Team Members** 			| S013 Ekaterina Eliseeva, S038 Natália Šeďová| 
| **Project Links** 		| [YT video example 1](https://youtube.com/shorts/5scMCeQZv-4?si=LEhGWvbCArpMe3Th) <br/> [YT video example 2](https://youtube.com/shorts/hg4zOMPK0O0?si=s0JlIHq_neA6Wcib) |     
| **Purpose** 				| Automate the process of watering flowers. The result should be useful in everyday life (less worry and more efficient use of time) and when away on holiday. |     
| **Individual Visions** 	| S013 Learn the basics of 3D printing, working with an Arduino (or micro:bit) and simplify the repetitive activity of watering flowers.<br/> S038 Learn the process of creating system from idea to the final product. Learn modeling and printing on 3D printer, working with Arduino (or micro:bit). |     
| **Team Vision** 			| Our goal is to make gardening more joyful and reduce the worries about growing plants. No need to guess if they are taken care of well enough, but instead to rely on technology and sensors. |     
| **Team Mission** 			| Create a plant watering device that simplifies the process of caring for houseplants and allows precise adjustment of the required moisture for each plant. |     
| **Strategy** 				| Analysis of the problem, getting informed about similar existing solutions.<br><br>Design of a 3D model inspired by existing solutions.<br><br>Identification and acquisition of necessary components (motor, sensors, Arduino) |     
| **End Customer** 			| Lovers of houseplants (team members) |     
| **Expected Effort** 		| 1h / member / week |     
| **Goals and Expectations** | Device prototype built, necessary documentation is created using diagrams |     
| **Solution Description** 	| A device capable of automatically watering plants based on the measurement of soil moisture from sensors. Powered by an electric motor and fueled by a battery. |  
| **Project Roadmaps** 		| W07 - primary discussion of plant watering issues<br><br>W08 - analysis of existing solutions, identification of necessary components<br><br>W09 - design and implementation of the circuit<br><br>W10 - creation of first versions of 3D models<br><br>W11 - creation of EA models<br><br>W12 - finalization of the prototype | 
| **Reached Results** 		| Two custom 3D models, functional circuit in Tinkercad, models in EA. |  
| **Experiences** 			| 3D modeling, EA collaboration, HW circuit creation | 
| **Positive experiences** 	|     |   
| **Potential for improvements** |    |
