| Individual visions   | • **S37**: My vision is to combine creativity and coding to create an interactive experience. It’s not only just about coding a car, it’s about fun and creative experience that will resonate with other people. <br/> • **S39**: To learn an instrument, you need to practice, practice, and practice. Practice isn’t always fun, though, especially if you’re a kid. In video games, you need a while to learn how to control your character, but you are then able to speed through the game with muscle memory. This is a similar principle to what I’d expect to achieve. <br/> • **S43**: It's wonderful how easy it is to train your models in Teachable Machine, and even more so when it's utilized for something as meaningful as teaching kids in a joyful manner. It’s not a secret that I'm not a big fan of boring teaching methods                                                                                                                               |

| Solution description | This project results in a car controlled by recorder sounds. The car can move in four directions, and each direction is represented by one note: <br/>• forward = e5 <br/>• backward = g5<br/> • left = b5 <br/> • right = d6 <br/> If the car receives an unfamiliar input (something that does not match the expected notes), it will do nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Roadmap              | • Research the technologies needed for the implementation <br/> • Train a model to recognize specific (recorder) notes <br/> • Connect the teachable machine functionality with mBot2 <br/> • Assemble and test the prototype                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Future work          | A way to build on this project is to add an element of competitiveness. Instead of one person controlling the snake car, two players are put against each other, with each snake car being controlled by different notes (or, perhaps, different instruments).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
