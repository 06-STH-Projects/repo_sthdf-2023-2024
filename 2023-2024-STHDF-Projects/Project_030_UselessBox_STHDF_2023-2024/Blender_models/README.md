# Folder containing Blender models

This folder contains the .blend files of the models as they had been modelled using the Blender modeling software.

The Blender version being used was 2.82.

As opposed to the .stl files, the .blend files also contain additional objects that have been omitted from the exported models, such as reference lighting and reference images (these are however not included).

The blend files contain the cat head with the cutout for a door hinge that holds the head attached to the box lid (katsunemiku2.blend), as well as the file in which the cat paw is matched with the box (uselessbox.blend).
