# Headlines - Short Description

More and more deaths are every year caused by drunk drivers. Not only that, but one-time-use alcohol testers are expensive and in some countries mandatory car equipment. We wish to motivate drivers to enhance the use of reusable alcohol testers. This can save them costs which in turn can also save the environment from pollution generated by gasses released during the production of one-time-use alcohol testers.  Another clear benefit is the amount of lives that the introduction of this project will save. The project should be offered in 2 possible options: built in 3D printed case (Can be used right away) and a DIY alternative where buyers get to build it themselves (With assistance from our documentation). Users will also get an option of battery or battery-less implementation.

# Description

In recent years, the alarming increase in fatalities resulting from drunk driving incidents has become a cause for serious concern. As the number of such tragic events continues to rise annually, there is a growing need for effective measures to address this issue and mitigate its impact on society. One potential solution that not only promotes road safety but also contributes to environmental conservation involves the widespread adoption of reusable alcohol testers.

The current landscape presents an additional challenge: the high cost associated with one-time-use alcohol testers. In some countries, these devices are not only expensive but also mandatory car equipment. This financial burden on drivers is a considerable factor, and addressing it could potentially lead to more widespread compliance with alcohol testing regulations. Our initiative aims to motivate drivers to transition to reusable alcohol testers, offering both economic and environmental benefits.

One of the primary advantages of embracing reusable testers is the potential for significant cost savings. By opting for a reusable device, drivers can avoid the recurring expenses associated with purchasing one-time-use testers. This, in turn, not only eases the financial strain on individuals but also promotes responsible behaviour by encouraging regular alcohol testing without the fear of added expenses.

Moreover, the environmental impact of one-time-use alcohol testers is often overlooked. The production and disposal of these single-use devices contribute to pollution, primarily through the release of gases during manufacturing processes. By choosing reusable testers, individuals can actively contribute to reducing their carbon footprint and promoting a more sustainable approach to personal safety.

To ensure the seamless integration of this initiative, we propose offering the reusable alcohol testers in two convenient options. The first option involves a built-in 3D printed case, providing users with a ready-to-use solution that requires minimal effort for implementation. This user-friendly approach aims to make the transition to reusable testers as straightforward as possible, catering to a broad spectrum of drivers.

For those who prefer a more hands-on experience, we introduce a DIY alternative where buyers can assemble the alcohol tester themselves. Accompanied by comprehensive documentation, this option allows users to actively participate in the creation of their safety equipment while also gaining a deeper understanding of its functionality. This educational component enhances the overall user experience and promotes a sense of ownership and responsibility.

Additionally, recognizing the diverse preferences and concerns of users, our initiative offers a choice between battery-powered and battery-less implementations. This flexibility ensures that the reusable alcohol testers can cater to a wide range of user needs and preferences, fostering inclusivity in the adoption of this life-saving technology.

In conclusion, the introduction of reusable alcohol testers presents a multifaceted solution to the pressing issues of drunk driving fatalities, financial strain on drivers, and environmental pollution. By providing options that prioritize convenience, affordability, and sustainability, our initiative strives to make a meaningful impact on road safety while promoting responsible and eco-friendly practices among drivers worldwide.

# Analysis

Before we begin with the implementation and design phase we first had to do some analysis of how this product will affect the market, what components will be necessary and how much will this tester cost. This involved building a Business analysis, Activity diagram, Use case diagram, Component diagram and Cost analysis.



## Business and cost analysis

Cost analysis of DIY alcohol tester (Cheapest possible version):

Arduino Nano clone - 4.5eur on average

3.3V → 5V PSU - 0.75eur on average

Case - Free (Up to 2eur if 3D Printed)

Oled Display - 4.5eur on average

MQ3 sensor - 2.5eur on average


The total cost of the cheapest project Alcohol tester is 12.25eur.

## The are multiple options for alcohol testers:

One-time use - 3eur on average

Multiple use - 25eur on average 

Disposable - 5.5eur on average

Our proposed DIY alcohol tester 12.25eur



If we compare a DIY alcohol tester to a Multiple-use tester, our solution is more than 50% cheaper and offers much better scalability. The downside is, that the project has to be assembled manually so its target group are mainly tech enthusiast drivers which is a very niche category. On the other hand, a person only needs to buy a one-time-use alcohol tester 4 times to even out the costs of DIY alcohol testers and only 2 times to even out the costs of DIY alcohol testers if they bought disposable alcohol tester. This can save lots of money per year in counties that have alcohol testers mandatory in vehicles. Another added benefit is that the product is very eco-friendly and due to the scalability of Arduino, it does not have to become waste once it becomes obsolete and can be turned into another product or geek idea compared to other testers which cannot be modified and do not reduce environmental impact.

## System diagram

As we can see, the system universally consists of 5 components, microprocessor, ethanol sensor, switch, display and battery if opted. Every of these components can vary and different variations can yield different outcome benefits. For example, choosing a microprocessor board with wifi can help us create a custom application for breathalysing.  Choosing a larger battery can make the device last longer or fitting a larger display can let us print much more data as output. Using better-grade ethanol sensors can make results even more precise. For now, the main application point is to be used as mandatory equipment in cars. Components will be picked according to that.

## Activity diagram

There are two situations that require a decision. The first situation evaluates if the MQ3 sensor is able to heat up. If it cannot heat up user is presented with the error MQ3 Failure. On the other hand, if the sensor heats up properly, the user is presented with either a Sober or Drunk status message based on input ethanol levels detected by the sensor.

## Use case diagram

As it is easy to deduct from the name of the project (Alcohol tester) what this product will allow the user to do/test, the use case diagram is straightforward in this case.

## Component diagram

The following diagram shows components that are necessary in order to accomplish our project. Two components are marked as optional because these are only required if the user wishes to create a battery-powered version of the alcohol tester.

# Design

During the design period, we studied possible solutions, that are reliable, cost-effective, not supply bound and as intuitive to build for the end user as possible. The design outcome is, that there are 4 different DIY alternatives for Alcohol testers:

- Arduino Uno version

- Arduino Uno version powered by Battery

- Arduino Nano version

- Arduino Nano version powered by Battery

Circuit diagram of the Arduino Uno version of Alcohol Tester:

<img width="606" alt="dfc64595-4e08-4963-a7e2-d130b1700a48" src="https://gist.github.com/assets/55763425/17785446-0091-4ae8-84fe-83ba4f50610b">

We decided, that users should be able to choose whether they wish to use the Battery version of Alcohol Tester or not. Thus we designed a battery version also.

<img width="760" alt="ca45c480-fba3-4033-8c1e-fc9a6f176afb" src="https://gist.github.com/assets/55763425/633c057a-8fae-46eb-a3c8-c383fc173f12">

As we already mentioned, there is also an Arduino Nano alternative for more DIY-oriented experts (Because it can be built in more compact cases), its diagram can be observed below:

<img width="50" alt="22d2dc63-c851-44e0-a8c9-47866b5d0808" src="https://gist.github.com/assets/55763425/dff9831d-6a6a-4fe0-9a51-b57751766154">

As Arduino Uno had a Battery alternative, Arduino Nano is also offered with a Battery alternative. Its schematics can be seen below:

<img width="50" alt="b061a7dd-5c8d-4935-bcc4-200128801107" src="https://gist.github.com/assets/55763425/48d65bd2-3df4-4054-b856-963a0a20dc68">

# Implementation

The code was produced using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) programming framework. It allows for direct and quick code upload into Arduino. The schematics were produced with [circuito](https://www.circuito.io/). As both components require 5V power output we had two options: 

Use Arduino Nano (Cheaper, fits smaller space)

Use Arduino Uno and be a plug-and-play (Offers more scalability for future circuitry updates)

We think, that both options are interesting and could offer another level of DIY difficulty for enthusiasts.

For demonstration purposes, we chose the second option to use Arduino Uno without Battery power.

Total components that are required for this build:

- Arduino (Nano/Uno)

- Battery (Optional, it is recommended to use Lithium batteries for maximal reliability and battery health)

- Oled Display (Optional)

- MQ3 Ethanol sensor

- External power supply 3.3V->5V (Mandatory with Nano)

- Case (Optional, but recommended for better transfer abilities)

## Prototype number 1

The display is meant to be behind the plexiglass, the Arduino on top and the MQ3 sensor in the back. This design turned out to be hard to use as the sensor is on the opposite side from the display. This limits users from seeing the status right away.

## Second prototype

In the second prototype, everything is connected and works as intended. The display and sensor are on the same side and Arduino is on top. After turning the device on the user needs to wait 20 seconds for the sensor to warm up. After that, users can begin to measure ethanol in their breath. This measurement is updated every second to provide accurate results. Based on the value that the MQ3 sensor outputs, users get notified if they are either sober or drunk.

# Validation, Verification

Our solution was evaluated with a basic test where we put a sensor towards a liquid containing alcohol. The solution acted as expected, displaying a Drunk message on display after it was exposed to ethanol.



As expected, the solution shows a “Sober” message when nothing is present in front of the sensor.

![36f786e7-2f87-4ad6-855d-ae265f494495](https://gist.github.com/assets/55763425/d4030833-d396-43ad-be27-ef3ab8ff0a55)

Once we present the sensor with something that contains ethanol, the sensor immediately senses it and informs us with the message “Drunk”.

# Lessons Learned

We found out, that the placement of components is important. Everything should be laid out to be convenient and easily accessible for users. We also gained experience working with Arduino and various components as well as experience in working with diagrams (Component, Use case and  Activity).

## The following diagram is deemed an ideal eco-friendly Alcohol tester product by AI:
