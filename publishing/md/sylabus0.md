|**Learning outcomes of the course unit:** |||||||
|The student will gain the knowledge needed to understand the systems that include IT solutions, at 3 basic levels  at the level of business processes, at the level of systems and at the technological level. The student is able to use a systematic approach to problem solving and gain the ability to think in the entire life cycle of the solution from the perspective of business and technical implementation of the solution.<br>In addition, the student will gain basic knowledge of digital fabrication technologies, how to generate computer code and turn it into material objects. In addition to theoretical knowledge, the student will also gain practical skills: how to use FabLab digital production tools for rapid prototyping, how to use CAD modeling software, vinyl and laser cutter, 3D scanning and printing, CNC milling, what the electronic construction and production of a printed circuit board looks like.|||||||
